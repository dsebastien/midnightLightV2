This folder should only contain TypeScript type definitions (.d.ts) files.
Type definition files should be installed using `typings install ... --save`; once that command is issued:
* typings.json will be updated
* the typings will be downloaded below this folder
* references to these typings files will be added to both `main.d.ts` and `browser.d.ts`

All type definition files in this folder will automatically be picked up by the TypeScript compiler.

For more details about the typings CLI, check out the official docs: https://github.com/typings/typings
