This folder should only contain TypeScript type definitions (.d.ts) files.
Type definition files should be installed using `tsd install <name> --save`; once that command is issued:
* tsd.json will be updated
* the typings will be downloaded below this folder
* references to these typings files will be added to `tsd.d.ts`

All type definition files in this folder will automatically be picked up by the TypeScript compiler.
