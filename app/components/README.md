# About
Should contain components including everything they're made of (e.g., controller, service, model, template, directive, filter, stylesheet, tests, ...).

# Design approach
The idea being to isolate components as much as possible so that removing one can be done in a clean manner without worrying (too much) about side-effects.
Think of components as custom elements that enclose specific semantics, styling, and behaviour.

A component should solve one problem and solve it well.

# Naming convention
Note that each component that includes TypeScript code MUST respect the following naming convention (not all files are required):
*  <component_name>: folder for the component (mandatory)
* _<component_name>.scss: styles for the component (optional)
*  <component_name>.model.ts: model of the component (optional)
*  <component_name>.controller.ts: controller of the component (mandatory)
*  <component_name>.controller_test.ts: tests for the controller of the component (recommended)
*  <component_name>.template.html: template/partial view of the component (mandatory)
*  <component_name>.service.ts: service for the component (optional)
*  <component_name>.service_test.ts: tests for the service of the component (optional)
*  <component_name>.directive.ts: directive of the component (optional)
*  <component_name>.directive_test.ts: tests for the directive of the component (optional)
*  <component_name>.filter.ts (optional)

Example:
```
components\
	login\
		login.scss
		login.model.ts
		login.controller.ts
		login.template.html
		...
```

If the component name is composed (which you should avoid if possible), then separate the parts with hyphens (-).

# Additional guidelines
* each component MUST be placed in its own directory
respect the namespace rule above to correctly isolate/encapsulate the component
* components CANNOT be nested (i.e., use a flat structure)

# CSS components
* all selectors in a component MUST start with the component name in order to create an isolated namespace for each component
* follow the design approach and naming convention described [here](../styles/README.md)
