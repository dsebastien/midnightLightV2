This folder should contain all the pages of the application.
Pages can be considered as "components" from an Angular point of view but:
- are aggregations of components & HTML/CSS/JS
- must have a view associated

The naming conventions are the same as for components with the following exceptions:
- the selector for a page should start with 'page-' to make the component 'type' apparent
