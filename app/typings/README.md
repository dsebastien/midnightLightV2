This folder should only contain custom TypeScript type definitions (.d.ts) files.

Only place your own type definitions here or ones that you must temporarily copy/modify.
Unless you have no choice, you should install type definitions using `typings install ... --save`.
 
If you install typings using the command above:
* typings.json will be updated
* the typings will be downloaded in the root typings folder (i.e., not this one)
* references to these typings files will be added to both `main.d.ts` and `browser.d.ts` in the root typings folder

All type definition files in this folder will automatically be picked up by the TypeScript compiler.

For more details about the typings CLI, check out the official docs: https://github.com/typings/typings
