Note that all SASS partials (files beginning with a _) should be placed in a sub-directory and should be imported by one of the SASS files in this folder

The vendor.scss (or vendor.css if renamed) file will be processed separately for dist

Styles guidelines:
- separate structure from chrome
- (re)use variables whenever possible
